          <h2>The Thesis</h2>
                  <p>The goals of this project are not precisely defined yet. We can easily achieve the requirements to get a passing score, but we want to challenge ourselves and see how far we can go now.</p>
                  <p>Building a regression model that predicts the price of a car using a dataset of 3 million rows and 66 columns would be laborious but easy, so we decided to go further.</p>
                  <p>Before we complete any of the parts of the project, we have to be sure that we can accomplish them, that is the project is a bit chaotic right now, but it is under control.</p>

                <h2>The Model</h2>
                  <p>Using Google Cloud we have built an initial model (catboost) that we want to improve.</p>
                  <p>We will also try to apply models such as Lasso, Elasticnet, Ensemble (gradient boosting) or even KNN if possible.</p>
                  <p>If possible, we will perform another model that, given a period of time (within the customer wants to sell the car), the model will output a prediction.</p>
                  <p>Imagine a customer that is in a hurry and needs the money ASAP. The model will output a price with a maximized benifit within a month. If the customer wants to get as much as possible,</p>
                  <p> the model will consider (for example) a period of six months and will output a higher price.</p>

                <h2>The Website</h2>
                  <p>The website is not a requirement in our thesis at all, but deploying models is something we want to learn and we thought it would be a good idea to do it now. Moreover, we are learning new technologies and languages.</p>
                  <p>Last week we knew barely nothing about CSS, HTML, Javascript or Django, and after a couple of days we were able to build the website. </p>
                  <p>The structure of the website will (probably) be:</p>
                  <p>The home page, with a little information about our "company", the model... and a "catchy" appearance.</p>
                  <p>A team section with a description of us.</p>
                  <p>The project section will consist of the "presentation" of the project. We will be using it during our presentation of the project instead of a PPT document. -So... it will be completely different as you can see it now.</p>
                  <p>The model section. The main page form will redirect here. There will be a form to fulfill with car specs so that the model predicts the price.</p>
                  <p>We still have a lot to do in that model because we want to improve the user experience of the form.</p>
                  <p>We are considering the option of integrating some intereactive visualizations, if possible, with tableau. But we are still thinking how to integrate it. It needs to make sense...</p>
                  <br>
                  <p>So, this is a little presentation of what we are doing. Thank you for your time!!!</p>
                  <p>The team</p>
